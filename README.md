# My Web Developer Portfolio

This site, written with React, serves the online portfolio of my work as a web developer.

Current projects highlighted include:

## Smart Brain

An application that allows a user, after registering, to submit the URL of an image and have the face in that image identified. The number of images a user submits is stored and presented to them each time.

Written using React and Node.js, utilizing a PostgreSQL database and the Clarifai image recognition API.

## Monster Mob

A 'directory listing' of monsters with contact information.

Written using React and pulls information JSONPlaceholder API and Robohash.org.

## A Simple Todo

A simple todo list application where a user can add, mark as complete, and delete task from a task list. There is no database so the application will be reset on a browser reload.

Written using React and pulls information from the JSONPlaceholder API.
